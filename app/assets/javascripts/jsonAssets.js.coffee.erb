Should only be needed in development only (i.e. for JSON assets)
-- unless we end up referencing other /asset files (like images?)
-- current limitation is that we have to manually reference each file
-- also, there's a gem for this: 'js_assets' but it didn't seem to work

@project_assets =
  <% 3.times do |i| %>
  'listings/<%= i %>.json': '<%= asset_path "listings/#{i}.json" %>',
  <% end %>
  'listings.json': '<%= asset_path "listings.json" %>'

# provides global JS function `asset_path()` which will give you access to proper asset pipeline file paths
@asset_path = (path) ->
  @project_assets[path]
