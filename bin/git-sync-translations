# NOTE:
# Even though this is setup as a shell script, for whatever reason running ./bin/git-sync-translations
# doesn't seem to run all the steps properly, it only really works if you copy/paste the below into
# your terminal and run it from there. Must be something about the shell user and the way it runs
# the git operations.

# reset the translations branch to == multilingual
# NOTE: can change this back to "master" once multilingual is merged
git checkout multilingual

git checkout -b translations
git push origin translations --force

# sync translation terms Github (translations branch) -> POE
# NOTE: Anything *new* that has been added to locale-en.json will get pulled into POE as a new term
# but it won't overwrite anything, to preserve any updates the content editors may have made.
# Before doing this: Check any new updates to existing strings in locale-en.json
# e.g. from a content update feature that has been merged to master, and make sure that content
# has been updated in POEditor.
