# NOTE:
# Even though this is setup as a shell script, for whatever reason running ./bin/git-sync-translations
# doesn't seem to run all the steps properly, it only really works if you copy/paste the below into
# your terminal and run it from there. Must be something about the shell user and the way it runs
# the git operations.
######

# 1. Locally reset the translations branch so it contains the latest from master. Push the new
# translations branch to GitHub.
git checkout master
git branch -D translations
git checkout -b translations
git push origin translations --force

# 1.5 Check any new updates to existing strings in locale-en.json e.g. from a content update feature
# that has been merged to master, and manually go into POEditor and update those terms in English. For
# any terms you manually update in English, mark the corresponding terms in each other language as "Fuzzy".

# 2. Sync translation terms from the Github translations branch -> POE.
# NOTE: Anything *new* that has been added to locale-en.json will get pulled into POEditor as a new term
# but it won't overwrite anything, to preserve any updates the content editors may have made. Doing
# step 1.5 first ensures that you can feel confident after running the below command that all updates
# from the translations branch are now in POEditor.
curl https://poeditor.com/api/webhooks/github?api_token=925b1c73349548271f2f228f8a7b3ce1&id_project=57183&language=en&operation=sync_terms_and_translations

# 3. Commit latest translations from POE -> the Github translations branch for all 4 languages.
# NOTE: An individual commit will be made on the translations branch per curl / language.

# 4. Locally re-sort the translations files on the translations branch and push again to GitHub.
git pull origin translations
grunt translations
git commit app/assets/json/translations/* -m '[translations] sorted translations after POEditor merge'
git push origin translations

# 5. Start the process of opening a PR from the translations branch to master on GitHub; view the diff.
open https://github.com/Exygy/sf-dahlia-web/compare/master...translations?expand=1

# 6. Once you have examined the PR diff, merge the PR to bring the translations updates from the
# translations branch into master.
