## Purpose ##

DAHLIA is the affordable housing portal for the City and County of San Francisco. It was created by the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD). This application streamlines the process of searching and applying for affordable housing, making it easier to rent, buy and stay in our City.

## Dependencies ##
Before you install DAHLIA, your system should have the following:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (see Gemfile for version)
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
- bundler `gem install bundler`
- [PostgreSQL](http://exponential.io/blog/2015/02/21/install-postgresql-on-mac-os-x-via-brew/)
- `brew install node`
- npm install -g grunt-cli (To run grunt commands globally)
- npm install bower

### Getting started ###
We will create a Boxen for this project, but for now to get started:

## How to Install ##
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Exygy/sf-dahlia-web.git`
2. Open a terminal window
3. Run `bundle install` in command line to download all necessary gems
3. Run `npm install` to run the js style and code linters
4. Run `overcommit --install` to install git hooks into the repo
5. Run `grunt`. Ensure that the *latest* pattern library is in the same folder as this repo.
Running grunt will migrate the css over from the patter library.
6. Run `rake bower:install`

### Acceptance/Feature Apps ###

Temporary "acceptance" apps are created upon opening a pull request for a feature branch. After the pull request is closed, the acceptance app is automatically spun down. See [this Heroku article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps) for details.

Dahlia's project backlog is in [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1405352).

### Code style and quality ###

#### Javascript ####

Javascript code quality is ensured by two npm packages: JsHint and JSCS. They will run automatically as a pre-commit hooks. Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style guide](http://nerds.airbnb.com/our-javascript-style-guide/).

#### Ruby ####
[Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) is configured in `.rubocop.yml` to enforce code quality and style standards based on the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and runs every time you commit using a pre-commit hook. Refer to the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) for all Ruby style questions.
To identify and have Rubocop automatically correct violations when possible, run:

* `rubocop -a [path_to_file]` for individual files
* `rubocop -a` for all Ruby files

#### JavaScript File Structure ####
