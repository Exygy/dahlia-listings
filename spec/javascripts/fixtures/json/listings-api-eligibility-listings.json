In the case of conversion, BMR renters will be afforded certain rights as explained in the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program Monitoring and Procedures Manual 2013. Applicants should inquire with the building contact person listed above to determine if the building has a minimum number of years that it must remain a rental building.  (Some buildings may have such restrictions based on government sources of financing for their building.) Most buildings may have no restrictions on conversion at all. \n\nIt is also important to note that units governed by the Inclusionary Housing Program are NOT governed by the San Francisco Rent Ordinance (also known as “rent control”). Among other rules, rents may increase beyond increases allowed under “rent control.”  Please see the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program Monitoring and Procedures Manual 2013 for more information.","Application_Organization":"The Gantry","Application_Street_Address":"2121 Third Street","Application_City":"San Francisco","Application_State":"CA","Application_Postal_Code":"94107","Application_Phone":"(910) 444-2061","Lottery_Summary":"Out of 162 application received, 20 number were pulled.","Lottery_Results_Date":"2015-12-03","Lottery_Start_Time":"11:00 AM","Lottery_Venue":"Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development","Lottery_Street_Address":"1 South Van Ness Avenue, 5th Floor","Lottery_City":"San Francisco","Lottery_Date":"2015-12-03T19:00:00.000+0000","Lottery_Results":true,"Lottery_Winners":20,"AMI_Percentage":55.0,"Credit_Rating":"Credit criteria is as follows: \r\n\r\nMaximum percentage of past due negative accounts: 40%\r\n\r\nMaximum balance of unpaid collections (includes past due accounts): $2,000\r\n\r\nBankruptcy permitted if cleared.","Criminal_History":"Qualified applicants with criminal history will be considered for housing in compliance with Article 49 of the San Francisco Police Code, The Fair Chance Ordinance.\r\n\r\nApplicants may not have a misdemeanor conviction in the last 3 years, pending misdemeanor cases not considered; may not have a felony conviction in the last 7 years, pending felony cases not considered; and may not be a registered sex offender.","Eviction_History":"An outstanding debt to a previous landlord or an outstanding insufficient funds check must be paid in full.\r\n\r\nApplications for residency will be denied for the following reasons:\r\nA breach of a prior lease or a prior eviction of any applicant or occupant, and/or more than four late pays and two insufficient fund checks in the last 24 months.\r\n\r\nIf no rental history exists, an additional deposit must be paid.","Leasing_Agent_Name":"Carl Carl","Leasing_Agent_Email":"cdavid@greystar.com","Leasing_Agent_Phone":"(910) 444-2061","Office_Open":"9:00 AM","Office_Closed":"6:00 PM","Fee":24.0,"Deposit_Min":941.0,"Costs_Not_Included":"The building pays water, sewer and trash only.
